categorical variables in the dataset into numeric variables.\nThere are 2 ways we can do this.\n\n* Category Indexing\n\n  This is basically assigning a numeric value to each category from {0, 1, 2, ...numCategories-1}.\n  This introduces an implicit ordering among your categories, and is more suitable for ordinal variables (eg: Poor: 0, Average: 1, Good: 2)\n\n* One-Hot Encoding\n\n  This converts categories into binary vectors with at most one nonzero value (eg: (Blue: [1, 0]), (Green: [0, 1]), (Red: [0, 0]))\n\nIn this dataset, we have ordinal variables like education (Preschool - Doctorate), and also nominal variables like relationship (Wife, Husband, Own-child, etc).\nFor simplicity's sake, we will use One-Hot Encoding to convert all categorical variables into binary vectors.\nIt is possible here to improve prediction accuracy by converting each categorical column with an appropriate method.\n\nHere, we will use a combination of [StringIndexer] and [OneHotEncoderEstimator] to convert the categorical variables.\nThe `OneHotEncoderEstimator` will return a [SparseVector]. Note: [OneHotEncoderEstimator] is [renamed as OneHotEncoder] in Spark 3.0.\n\nSince we will have more than 1 stage of feature transformations, we use a [Pipeline] to tie the stages together.\nThis simplifies our code.\n\n[StringIndexer]: http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html#stringindexer\n[OneHotEncoderEstimator]: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html#onehotencoderestimator\n[SparseVector]: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.linalg.SparseVector\n[Pipeline]: http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.Pipeline\n[renamed as OneHotEncoder]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26133"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"59528e98-956b-44d6-bf0c-15ff1a7188e9"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pyspark\nfrom pyspark.ml import Pipeline\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer, VectorAssembler\n\nfrom distutils.version import LooseVersion\n\ncategoricalColumns = [\"workclass\", \"education\", \"marital_status\", \"occupation\", \"relationship\", \"race\", \"sex\", \"native_country\"]\nstages = [] # stages in our Pipeline\nfor categoricalCol in categoricalColumns:\n    # Category Indexing with StringIndexer\n    stringIndexer = StringIndexer(inputCol=categoricalCol, outputCol=categoricalCol + \"Index\")\n    # Use OneHotEncoder to convert categorical variables into binary SparseVectors\n    if LooseVersion(pyspark.__version__) < LooseVersion(\"3.0\"):\n        from pyspark.ml.feature import OneHotEncoderEstimator\n        encoder = OneHotEncoderEstimator(inputCols=[stringIndexer.getOutputCol()], outputCols=[categoricalCol + \"classVec\"])\n    else:\n        from pyspark.ml.feature import OneHotEncoder\n        encoder = OneHotEncoder(inputCols=[stringIndexer.getOutputCol()], outputCols=[categoricalCol + \"classVec\"])\n    # Add stages.
